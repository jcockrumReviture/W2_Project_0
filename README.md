    This program will accept 2 diffrent input types: 
    a "live" punch,     
            If you are clocking in what times your upcomming breaks and clock times are.
            If you are clocking out, how many hours have been logged.
    a "hours" punch
        for this punch you will enter the hours you have completed and a start time, which will enter a row in the timesheet table of what hours you punched in and out and when you took breaks based on a standard work day split
